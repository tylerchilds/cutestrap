A sassy, opinionated CSS Framework. A tiny alternative to Bootstrap.

[Docs/Demo](https://www.cutestrap.com/)

### Features

* Vertical Rhythm
* Consistent pattern for form fields
* 8kb minified
* Smart defaults for all default elements (Conventional)
* CSS specificity is very low in the class hierarchy (Configurable)
* Solid foundation for a living styleguide using KSS

## Installation

To use the CSS as is, you can install using npm or bower:

```
npm install cutestrap
```

```
bower install cutestrap
```

If you want to create your own styleguide, fork the repository and modify the `src` and `kss-html` folders.

### Gallery

Have you built a site using Cutestrap? I'll be creating a gallery, so email a link and an thumbnail image to [mailto:cutestrap@bamzap.pw](cutestrap@bamzap.pw). The thumbnail should be sized 300px width by 240px height.

### Development

After cloning, you'll first need to install dependencies by running `npm run setup`.

After that just run `npm start`.

KSS will generate the docs from the `kss-html` folder. The `dist` folder is created from  the `src` folder.

### Contributors

Contributors are welcome, just follow these few guidelines:

* Avoid checking in compiled files (dist and docs folders) as this will reduce merge conflicts with master
* BEM for naming conventions
* Alphabetical properties
* Only nest for pseudo-elements
