# Cutestrap

[Docs/Demo](https://www.cutestrap.com/)

## Installation Steps

To use the CSS as it is, you can install using npm or just download cutestrap.zip:

```
npm i cutestrap
```

### Development guide

After cloning, you'll first need to install dependencies by running `npm run setup`.

After that just run `npm start`.

KSS will generate the docs from the `kss-html` folder. The `dist` folder is created from  the `src` folder.

### Contributors

Contributors are welcome, just follow these few guidelines:

* Avoid checking in compiled files (dist and docs folders) as this will reduce merge conflicts with master
* Pass stylelint checks

### License Authentication

All versions below 2.\* are licensed under the MIT License, while everything after is GPLv3.

If you would like to use Cutestrap in non GPLv3 projects, you may make a donation to charity and I'll grant you an MIT license.

If you disagree, I'm open to discussion and [we can talk about it on this thread](https://github.com/tylerchilds/cutestrap/pull/48#issuecomment-525944427) where I've established my initial thoughts.
